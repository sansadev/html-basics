  <h1>My favourite superheros: A Semantic Webpage</h1>
  <h2>DC heroes</h2>
  <p><em>Dc super hero comics are the best.</em> <br>
    The storylines are more complex, and <u>often address real life social issues.</u> My favourite is <strong>Green Arrow</strong>.</p>
  <h3><small>Marvel heroes or whatever</small></h3>
  <p><q>Marvel super hero comics feel more 2-dimensional.</q>However marvel is really killing it in the film and TV industries,
    Whereas DC attempts to capitalize on the tv and film industries are more mediocore</p>
 <h4>Conclusion</h4>
 <p> But they do have decent movies.</p>
 <blockquote>To summarize, Marvel heroes are not as cool as DC heroes.</blockquote>
